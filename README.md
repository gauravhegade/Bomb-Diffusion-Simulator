# Bomb-Diffusion-Simulator
The Bomb Diffusion Simulator is an interactive project that simulates the process of defusing a bomb using a set of electronic components and a microcontroller, specifically the LPC2148. The simulator integrates a proximity sensor, LCD display, matrix keyboard, and seven-segment display to create a realistic and engaging experience.
